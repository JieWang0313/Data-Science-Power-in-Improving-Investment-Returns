These are the visualizations of the correlation analysis results. 


**Pearson Heatmap** displays the linear correlation between variables, suitable for data that follows a normal distribution and has linear relationships. The color intensity in the heatmap represents the Pearson correlation coefficient, with darker colors indicating a stronger linear relationship.


**Spearman Heatmap** shows the monotonic relationships between variables, suitable for data that does not follow a normal distribution or has non-linear relationships. Since Spearman correlation is based on ranks, it can reveal the strength of relationships even if they are non-linear.
