These are the visualizations of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Factor Analysis.


Scree Plot: Helps in selecting the appropriate number of factors by showing the variance explained by each factor. The "elbow" point in the plot indicates the optimal number of factors to retain.


3D Factor Analysis Plot: Displays data points in a 3D space based on the top three factors, allowing for a visual analysis of clustering patterns and group structures.


Factor Pair Scatter Plot: Shows pairwise relationships between extracted factors, helping to analyze the correlation or independence among factors.
