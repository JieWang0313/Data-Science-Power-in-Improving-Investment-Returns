# Enhancing Investment Returns with Machine Learning 
In an era where stock markets are becoming more complicated and elusive, investors are usually overwhelmed by numerous information and data from the market. So, how to minimize risk, boost returns, and even achieve excess gains has become a major focus for investors. We understand that achieving the right balance between security and opportunity is essential in today’s dynamic market environment. That’s why we aim to empower investors through data science techniques, helping them unlock better returns in the stock market. With advanced analytics, we provide insights that make smarter, more profitable decisions possible. 

Machine learning (ML), a branch of data science, with its ability to analyze vast datasets and recognize complex patterns, has emerged as a promising tool for understanding and predicting stock market movements. Our mini project explores how ML techniques can improve investment returns by accurately predicting stock price trends, with a particular focus on Tesla as a case study. 
## Understanding Challenges in Stock Market 
Forecasting stock prices is notoriously challenging due to the volatile and dynamic nature of the market. Some challenges will arise when we want to make a prediction, like how to choose the timing, how to find the important indicators, how to obtain possible future information, and how to stay sensible during the decision-making process. Here are some examples of the challenges that can be shown in Tesla in the following picture. 

Stock price patterns can be hard to predict, with significant fluctuations and some periods of sharp ups and downs. Navigating this volatility requires a keen understanding and the right tools to stay ahead.  

Trading volume shows the market’s activity level and investors' enthusiasm for Tesla. It’s clear, however, that any patterns in trading are quite subtle, underscoring how challenging it can be to time stock trades effectively and maintain a steady, rational approach in a volatile market.

## Aha Moment 
Therefore, we are here, trying to offer a possible solution to solve the above challenges through our project. Traditional methods often fall short when attempting to capture the non-linear patterns inherent in stock prices. So, we are planning to use data science to empower investment stock investment, leveraging ML techniques into stock price prediction, specifically a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, which is well-suited for time series data. This approach enables investors to better anticipate price fluctuations and refine their investment strategies by providing insights grounded in data. 

## Insights and values - Key Indicators 
Before applying our ML models for prediction, we conducted an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain deeper insights into stock-related data and offer valuable perspectives for investors. A key part of this process was using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify major factors impacting stock prices. By pinpointing these key indicators, we empower investors to analyze investment strategies more efficiently and make smarter decisions. 

We conducted correlation tests and the KMO test to examine relationships among the variables, ensuring they’re well-suited for PCA. This approach allows us to focus on the most influential factors, delivering more targeted insights for investors.
