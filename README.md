# LSTM-Stock-Price-Prediction-Model
This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict stock prices, supporting investors in maximizing their returns. The model developed aims to forecast stock prices by analyzing historical data and incorporating external factors, such as public interest trends measured through Google Trends.
## Introduction
The stock market plays a significant role in both personal and institutional investment strategies. Predicting stock prices can provide investors with valuable insights into market trends and fluctuations. However, forecasting these prices is challenging due to the complex and non-stationary nature of stock market data. This project focuses on using machine learning techniques to predict stock prices and assist investors in optimizing their investment returns. The target audience includes both individual and institutional investors who seek to enhance their decision-making processes.
The machine learning model developed in this project aims to predict stock prices by analyzing historical stock data and other external factors like public interest, as observed through Google Trends. The primary goal is to create a system that can effectively predict trends and improve the overall accuracy of stock price forecasts.
##  Technical details
### Data collection
The project only uses publicly available data, and there are no privacy concerns related to individual-level data. In this project, we selected Tesla's stock data from January 2021 to September 2024. Data was collected from two primary sources:
- 项目功能
  - 数据收集
  - 数据分析
  - 模型预测

1. 第一步：收集数据
2. 第二步：数据清洗
3. 第三步：构建模型
